# Hostel Management System

The Hostel Management System, using the MERN stack, helps university hostel admins and students handle student meals and food reviews easily. It allows secure logins, lets admins manage meals and student data, and enables both admins and students to review and update food reviews. It works well on phones, tablets, and computers, keeps users logged in securely, and sends alerts for important updates.
